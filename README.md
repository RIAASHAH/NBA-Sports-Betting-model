# NBA-Sports-Betting-model
This project introduces a Machine Learning AI designed to predict winners and under/overs in NBA games. Utilizing team data spanning from the 2007-08 NBA season to the current season, along with historical betting odds, the AI leverages a neural network to forecast winning bets for today's games. The project also leverages the Live Sports Odds API to identify statistical arbitrage opportunities in upcoming sporting events worldwide. For sports betting, an arbitrage opportunity exists when different bookmakers offer odds that allow a bettor to place specific bets with each, guaranteeing a profit regardless of the event outcome.
Along with the above two, there is a reddit sentimental analyser to see if it is worth making the bet or not. Lastly, there is a video replay analyser that uses chatgpt-4 vision preview to analyse previous games.
